### Help and Usage - ZeroCode REST BDD - A REST Testing Framework 

#### How to run the examples?

> Step-1: 
Import the maven project `zerocode-rest-help` i.e. /helpme/zerocode-rest-help/pom.xml

> Step-2: 
Start the `Mock REST server` i.e. just Run as main() -> src/test/java/org/jsmart/zerocode/testhelp/tests/RunMeFirstRESTServer.java

Note- 
You need not do this Step-2 if you have a real or mock REST service running somewhere else. 
You can simply update the `host` and `port` information in the config file. of your test.

> Step-3: 
Run the tests one by one as JUnit way i.e. ZeroCodeSampleTests.java under `src/test/java/org/jsmart/zerocode/testhelp/tests/`

> -OR-

> Run all tests in folder "tests" as Suite i.e. ZeroCodeSampleBulkTests.java under `src/test/java/org/jsmart/zerocode/testhelp/tests/`

That's it. Now you can fiddle with the values in the `assertions` section of any test and re-run to FAIL it, 
then update to correct value to PASS it.
